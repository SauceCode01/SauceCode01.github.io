				A decimal number is a number that is composed of two parts separated by a decimal point. 
				The whole number part and the fractional part.
			</p>
			<p>
				Division with decimal is not very different with division with integers except that there is a decimal point.
			</p>
			<h2>How to do division with decimals?</h2>
			<p>
				To make it easier to follow, we divided the lesson into three parts:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>whole number divided by a decimal.</li>
				<li>decimal divided by a whole number.</li>
				<li>decimal divided by a decimal.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Decimal divided by a whole number</h2>
			<p>
				Question: What is 24 divided by 4.8?
			</p>
			<p>
				Write down the dividend and the divisor in the format below. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Place a decimal point directly above the decimal point of the dividend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Do long division like normal.
			</p>


			<h2>Whole number divided by a decimal</h2>
			<p>
				Question: what is 7.83 divided by 3?
			</p>	
			<p>
				Write down the dividend and the divisor in the format below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Move the decimal point of the divisor until it become a whole number. Count the number of steps the decimal point has to take to be a whole number.
			</p>
			<p>
				Put a zero to the dividend depending on the number of steps you counted. If you counted 2 steps, then put 2 zeros at the end of the dividend.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the dividend is still a decimal, go back to the first case where we are dividing a decimal with a whole number.
			</p>

			<h2>Decimal divided by a decimal</h2>
			<p>
				Question: What is 6.25 divided by 0.25?
			</p>
			<p>
				Write down the dividend and the divisor in the format below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Move the decimal point of the divisor until it become a whole number. Count the number of steps the decimal point has to take to be a whole number.
			</p>
			<p>
				Move the decimal point of the divisor to the right the same number of steps that you counted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do the steps in the first case where we divide a whole number by a decimal.
			</p>

			<h1>Example questios</h1>
			<h3>1. What is 2.5 divided by 13.25</h3>
			<p>
				This problem falls under case number 3. Decimal divided by a decimal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arrange the divisor and the dividend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Move the decimal point of the divisor to the right until the divisor became a whole number.
			</p>
			<p>
				The decimal point needed two steps so that the divisor is a whole number. Move the decimal point of the dividend two steps to the right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do normal division.
